		<h1>How I work</h1>
			<p>Before I start rambling on different techniques I like to use or software programs and what not 
			let me introduce myself, I'm Samuel Gipson and my career goal is to become a front end web developer.  I have switched my career path so many times in my college career that it wasn't until my junior year that I found my passion.</p>
		<h2 id="good">The Good</h2>
			<p>On a typical day I start with getting a little exercise and a good breakfast, otherwise I feel that I spend longer amounts of time on my homeowrk because my brain feels like mush.  So given that I have started my day with a fresh start I start with homework.  Depending on how long it takes I try to finish it in time so that I can work on other projects for hobbies like CodeAcedemy.com or TeamTreehouse.com.  I find that with a great schedule to plan out your priorities the efficiency is unmatched!</p>
		<h2 id="bad">The Bad</h2>
			<p>Well it seems as though I stayed up a little late last night which I try not to do because my next day is that much shorter.  I awake some hours past my usual time and skip my workout routine in order to ketch up on homework.  After spending a few hours on homework I realize I forgot to eat breakfast.  That's probably why it took me 3 hours to do the homework in the first place, that and not excercising.Now I'm eating breakfast, well that is if you call chips breakfast at one in the afternoon.  However I'm behind and need to ketch up!  At the end of the day I'm exhausted from turning my mind to goo afrom the homework that I don't have the effort to put into CodeAcademy or TeamTreehouse. This was not my best day.</p>
		<h2 id="ugly">The Ugly</h2>
			<p>Well I'm sure you can guess how this day goes. I awake in a daze thinking it's 10am only to realize the clock says 1pm.  Well I guess I shouldn't have stayed up until 3pm watching Game of Thrones while playing StarCraft 2.  I probably also shouldn't of had a whole Dominoes pizza to myself a long with whatever else I could get my hands on at 3 in the monring.  I get out of bed, go over to the kitchen to find a mess I didn't feel like cleaning before.  After cleaning and eatching some brunch it is now 2:30pm and my day is passing right by me.  Of course I also forgot about the 8 page paper due tonight, probably a side effect of Game of Thones. I forget the side projects for the day and end up working on the paper until late in the night, leading to a bad day next.</p>
